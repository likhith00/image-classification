# image-classification
Image classification involves predicting the class of object/objects in image. There are different types of classification based on class and labels. I will try to upload the various type of classification models.

[cats_and_dogs_classification.ipynb](https://github.com/likhith00/image-classification/blob/master/cats_and_dogs_classification.ipynb) is the implementation of simple classification model.Cats and dogs dataset with 2000 training images and 600 validation images is used in this project. I've trained my model with the help of google colab and I've accessed my dataset by mounting google colab with google drive. The model performance is average with considerable accuracy but fluctuating validation loss
